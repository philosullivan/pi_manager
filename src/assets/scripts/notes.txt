Here is how to read the current state of the I2C port:
    sudo raspi-config nonint get_i2c
This command will return:
    1 if the port is disabled
    0 if the port is enabled


Here is how to enable the I2C port:
    sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
Again, note that 0 means true / on here!
Here is how to disable the I2C port:
    sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 1
1 means “false” or off for this purpose.
